# SaliStreamMQTT
It's my first applications on OS with JAVA, i had clone some Skype's feature like call, send message. But one thing special in my app, it have live stream feature like facebook, so great. Look at overview it also had a good UI and also can run online if you provide a good enviroment with MQTT(Broker). Would be great if anybody want to reference and make a same app.


whether you want run my project on localhost:1883, you must install MQTT first. unless you want to run online with broker: iot.eclipse.org or something else support MQTT enviroment, you don't need to install anything just had java in your OS.
